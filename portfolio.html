                I got sent to juvie in my young teens because I tried to assassinate the king of Norway and claim his title for my own.
                I was originally going to spend 2 years, but because of my behavior I got out after only 1 year.
                I learned a lot of social skills, management, and leader skills there.
                I got friends there who inspired me to start the journey of programming.

            <p>
                I was on a practicum collage course where I got to work with a well known company named “Oculus Rift”.
                I went to meet them on a seminar and showed them some of my work.
                I did amazingly on my courses and showed a great interest in programming, so one Google employee scouted me.
                He said he saw potential and wondered if I wanted to trial for a Google internship.

            <hr>
            <p>
                I was one of the few lucky who got <strong>accepted to trial for the google internship.</strong>
                There were many other participants competing to get the internship at Google, 
                and we were put through a lot of trials and coding tests.
                I used my knowledge to my best and got accepted with a few others.
                I got sent a goodie bag from them before I started, and then I went to Google headquarters in California,
                USA. Everything was really fun! 
                Furthermore <em>I learned a lot of coding and the structures around it</em> during my time as a GoogleIntern.
