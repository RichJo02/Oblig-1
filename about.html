            <h1>About this project</h1>
             <p>
                Before we started our project we discussed what uses different semantic tags had and what they could do.
                Then we tried some of them out to find out what we liked the most. 
                We then tried to implement everything we found interesting, and told ourselves we had to include as much as possible.
                We had a great vision of what we wanted to achieve, but to not chew more than we could swallow we had to cut a lot of ideas down.
                Our decision making was mostly based on our vision and what was we saw as most visually pleasing.

                The layouts we used for the different pages were implemented to try and get as close as possible to the image we had in our head.
                As an example, we used a lot of div>, we used this tag to build the foundation for our website.
                After we had made the foundation for our website we did our best to implement different tags like article>, footer>, header> etc.
                So that our html-files were more readable and to better show the meaning behind the different texts on our website. 
                We used the tag nav> were we put in the links to the different html-documents of our website, 
                furthermore we used the ul> and li> tags to structure the links inside the nav>. 
                We also used a tag called section>. We used this tag when we had to structure pieces of text together,
                but at the same time thought it did not seem fit to use the tag article>.
                Furthermore we also chose to use tags like b> and strong> to put pressure on words or sentences that we deemed important to the viewer of the website.
                We also used the tag em> to define names and such in italics so that the reader might look at those words with more caution. 
                The ul> and li> tags were not only used to structure the the different links in our website, 
                but we also used it in general when we thought of structuring things in a list.
